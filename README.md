workouts that work for women


The COVID-19 pandemic has made it significantly harder for the general public to connect with friends, keep an energized body, and achieve mental calmness. Furthermore, lack of exercise has also caused a spike in depression, obesity, and heart-disease cases. The importance of adopting a healthy lifestyle is essential, now more than ever, while most people are working at home and students have virtual school sessions.

However, as many women know, going to a physical gym is extremely daunting. “​​A new study has revealed nearly three quarters of women have been made to feel uncomfortable whilst at the gym. Sports nutrition brand DNA Lean surveyed **400 women and found 73 percent of them have been made to feel uncomfortable whilst working out.**” Although there are women-only gyms, they aren’t always financially feasible for all women.

So, we wanted to provide an **alternative for ALL women**; so everyone can feel safe getting fit. Our team developed Fit & Femme, a smart machine-learning based personal fitness trainer that gives the general public, specifically women, the tools, motivation, and support needed to stay fit. Additionally, it makes sure that the user has the correct form to ensure they don’t get any injuries.
